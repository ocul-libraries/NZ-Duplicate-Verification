# NZ-Duplicate-Verification
This project compares eight key descriptors in bibliographic records to verify true duplicates before merging. It uses a CSV input and JSON transformation rules, then outputs a merge-combine.csv file that can be used with Alma's built in Merge Records and Combine Inventory job. 

The key descriptors are:
- 'OCLC Control Number (035a)'
- 'Material Type'
- 'Language Code'
- 'Language Of Cataloging'
- 'Edition Simplified (Num)'
- 'Edition Simplified (Text)'
- 'Publisher' #Normalized with JSON files
- 'Publication Date' #Normalized with JSON files

# Requirements
Python: 3.8 or higher

Libraries (install via pip):
- pandas 
- openpyxl 
- xlsxwriter

# Files & Folders

**`main folder/`**
- **`data/`** → This is where you will store the CSV export from Alma Analytics.
- **`json/`** → Transformation rules (publisher edits, publication date edits).  
- **`output/`** → Files generated by script will be stored here.
- **`config.json`** → Defines file paths. If you want to change filenames or folders, update config.json accordingly.
- **`ocul-cf_nz_duplicate_verification.py`** → Main script that processes the data.  

# Usage
- Export CSV file from the Alma Analytic file path:
  * /Shared Folders/UTON Network 01OCUL_NETWORK/Reports/NZ Duplicates - for script/NZ Duplicates - TEMPLATE
- Place the CSV file in the **`data/`**
- Run the script: **`ocul-cf_nz_duplicate_verification.py`**
- Final mapped CSV is in the **`output/merge-combine.csv`**
